Writing comprehensive test files with high coverage is an effective way to ensure that 
code is functional and secure.  A test file with high coverage of the file which it is 
meant to test should cover as many lines as possible, and cover a wide variety of 
possible input.  Input to be tested for should come from project requirements and from 
error guessing by experienced developers and/or testers.  

In order to interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program, a specific and 
comprehensive list of requirements should be made so that user needs are organized into 
a format which can be addressed sequentially as code is written.  

My approach to designing software involves careful attention to the client’s expressed 
needs, and constant consideration of what could go wrong with any code which I am 
writing.  I make a list of possible bugs or errors as code is being developed so that 
when it’s time to write my tests, I can address concerns which came to me during 
development in my error guessing.  A product which is comprehensively tested has a 
significantly lower chance of causing trouble after deployment than a system which has 
not been properly tested.
